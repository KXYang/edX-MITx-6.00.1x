# Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

# Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, 
# if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

# Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
# In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

# Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc

# Paste your code into this box 

letter = s[0]
longest = s[0]

            mlen = len(letter)
            longest = letter
    else:
        letter=s[i + 1]
